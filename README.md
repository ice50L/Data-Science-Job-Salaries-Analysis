# Data-Science-Job-Salaries-Analysis

# Introduction:
In this project, we explore the various jobs in the data science field and compare the salaries for most represented professions. The areas that are explored are the individual jobs, the seniority level pay, company size, if the companies are mostly remote or on-site, etc. Ever since the period
of covid, many companies have moved to remote work instead of the traditional on-site work. Correlations are explored between each variable that each job has.
